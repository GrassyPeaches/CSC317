## Member Contribution Breakdown

* Syed Shah:
    * Contributed to frontend design and overall user experience.
    * Created the complete New Recipe page layout, including input fields for title, description, ingredients, and steps.
    * Developed dynamic JavaScript functionality for adding multiple ingredients (name, unit, quantity) and automatically numbered steps. Refined CSS styling to improve spacing, alignment, and visual consistency across recipe-related pages.
    * Added the Delete Recipe button to both profile page recipe cards and the individual recipe view.
    * Improved project structure by organizing frontend files and cleaning up layout inconsistencies.
    * Fixed UI issues that appeared after merges to ensure smooth interaction between all frontend components.

* Graciela Ramirez
    * Wrote most of the back-end logic, including building tables, routing, controllers, and database operations.
    * Set up PostgreSQL schemas and integrated queries with EJS templates. 
    * Contributed to project documentation and endpoint descriptions.
    * Helped debug API issues using Postman.

* Shreya
    * Worked primarily on the front-end design and user experience for the Platemate project. My contributions included improving overall UI consistency, adding a custom error page to provide clearer feedback for users, and implementing the front-end interface for the Edit Recipe feature by extending the existing Add Recipe flow. These updates focused on usability and accessibility while integrating seamlessly with the existing project structure without altering backend logic.

## Collaboration Process

We collaborated using GitHub and Pull Requests to track progress and assign tasks.
Communication occurred through Zoom meetings, WhatsApp, and Discord to make design 
decisions, discuss blockers, and review code together.

## Tools & Technologies Used

[CSS, EJS, PostgreSQL, PostMan, Zoom, WhatsApp, Discord, GitHub]

---

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

* Database connection errors:
We encountered issues with environment variables not loading correctly. 
This was resolved by reconfiguring the .env file and ensuring all team 
members used matching database credentials.

* Merge conflicts on shared templates:
Since multiple members edited EJS files, and at times naming conventions were mismatched,
conflicts occurred. 
We resolved this by assigning clear responsibilities for each template and 
performing more frequent commits.

* Styling inconsistencies:
Components looked different across pages. 
A shared CSS style guide was created to unify spacing, colors, and typography.

## Testing

* Used Postman to test all API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for recipes and user profiles.

* Manually tested form submissions across browsers to ensure proper validation.

* Verified database operations by checking PostgreSQL tables after each CRUD action.

## Final Notes

We successfully built a functional recipe website by dividing tasks based on strengths and communicating consistently.
Each member contributed to both design decisions and debugging. 

We would like to acknowledge the collaborative effort 
that made this final product possible!
