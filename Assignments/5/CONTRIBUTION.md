## Collaboration Process

We collaborated using GitHub and Pull Requests to track progress and assign tasks.
Communication occurred through Zoom meetings, WhatsApp, and Discord to make design 
decisions, discuss blockers, and review code together.

## Tools & Technologies Used

[CSS, EJS, PostgreSQL, PostMan, Zoom, WhatsApp, Discord, GitHub]

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

* Database connection errors:
We encountered issues with environment variables not loading correctly. 
This was resolved by reconfiguring the .env file and ensuring all team 
members used matching database credentials.

* Merge conflicts on shared templates:
Since multiple members edited EJS files, and at times naming conventions were mismatched,
conflicts occurred. 
We resolved this by assigning clear responsibilities for each template and 
performing more frequent commits.

* Styling inconsistencies:
Components looked different across pages. 
A shared CSS style guide was created to unify spacing, colors, and typography.

## Testing

* Used Postman to test all API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for recipes and user profiles.

* Manually tested form submissions across browsers to ensure proper validation.

* Verified database operations by checking PostgreSQL tables after each CRUD action.

## Final Notes

We successfully built a functional recipe website by dividing tasks based on strengths and communicating consistently.
Each member contributed to both design decisions and debugging. 

We would like to acknowledge the collaborative effort 
that made this final product possible!
