      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Graciela, a junior studying Computer Science at San Francisco
        State University. I’m passionate about learning new programming
        languages and exploring how they can be applied to solve real-world
        problems. Beyond technology, I believe that health is one of the most
        important pillars of a good life. One area I’m especially interested in
        is the intersection of nanotechnology and exercise science. The idea of
        optimizing human performance and well-being through innovative research
        excites me, and I hope to contribute to advancements that improve
        people’s quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not programming, I enjoy hiking, baking, and dancing. Lately,
        I’ve been on the fun (and sometimes messy) adventure of learning to
        cook. My proudest creations so far are a hearty clam chowder paired with
        homemade bread—soft on the inside with a golden, flaky crust. For
        desserts, I love making (and eating, of course!) tres leches cake and
        tangy lemon bars. Staying active is also important to me: I love
        strength training at the gym, and I’ve recently branched out into
        learning salsa and bachata. These hobbies not only keep me moving but
        also help me stay balanced, creative, and mentally refreshed.
