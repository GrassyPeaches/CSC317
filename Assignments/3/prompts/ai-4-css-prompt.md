Create a complete, validation-safe CSS stylesheet for a personal portfolio website. It should work with semantic HTML elements (nav, header, main, section, footer) and with common section IDs (about, education, experience, projects, skills). The CSS must be standalone, with no external frameworks or font imports, and it should pass the W3C CSS Validator. It needs to be responsive, include visible focus states for accessibility, and style at least one image (like a profile photo or project thumbnail) with rounded corners, object-fit, and a subtle shadow.

The visual style should be a clean, modern editorial look, light theme by default. Use this color palette: background #f7f8fb, panel/card #ffffff, primary text #1a1d29, muted text #5a6376, accent #3b82f6, border #e4e7ee. Use the system font stack. Headings (h1 to h3) should have a clear hierarchy and comfortable line-height. Use this spacing scale in rem: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3. Card corners should be 14px. Include subtle shadows. The layout should be mobile-first, with a max content width of about 1120px and comfortable side gutters. The projects section should be a responsive grid: 1 column on phones, 2 columns on tablets (640px and up), and 3 columns on desktops (1024px and up).

All interactive elements (links, buttons, nav items) should have hover and focus styles, and transitions should be smooth for color and small transforms. Include styles for: global containers/utilities, a sticky top navigation with active and hover states, a hero or intro block, sections for about, education, experience, projects, and skills, cards for projects/experience entries, and a footer.

Do not use vendor-specific hacks or CSS that would break validation. Declare design tokens using CSS variables on :root. As an optional enhancement, add a minimal prefers-color-scheme: dark section that reuses the same tokens for dark mode.

Output only the CSS file content, fully written and ready to save as ai-3.css, and add sensible comments for the main sections. Keep selectors fairly generic so this stylesheet can coexist with other stylesheets.
