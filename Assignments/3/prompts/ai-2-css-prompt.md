Here’s a list of my prompts:

1-The CSS file you will create is called ai-2, since it is the second theme option. Create a CSS that is for this portfolio website, use a betty boop theme (blacks, whites, reds and cute font for all the font even the buttons, have the buttons shoot out hearts when hovered over and accessible for all). Style the whole page, enable scrolling throughout the sections that way sections are clearly distinguished. <!DOCTYPE html> …

2-Almost there, make sure to include the background pattern (red hearts and polka dots) and include the favicon. Make sure to include the font everywhere even the buttons

3-Is this accessible for all users? if not make it so

4-The paragraph colors are almost impossible to see now, everything looks good but you need to change this part of the css and make sure you review it all one more time to insure the colors contrast enough
