## Individual Reflections

### [Member 1 Name] - Hand-written CSS (Part 1)
[Individual reflection on lessons learned and contribution to hand-written CSS]

### [Graciela Ramirez] - Hand-written CSS (Part 2)
At first, I struggled with getting layouts to align properly and remembering how different properties like flexbox, margins, and padding interact. At time I was mixing up units, which then encouraged me to write some notes to structure the whole page and base it off of. Over time, I became more comfortable experimenting with colors, spacing, and responsive design, I actually learned that debugging styles can be just as much of a headache as resolving programming errors. However, I did thoroughly enjoy researching and practicing all the handy tools involved as well as experimenting with design. Overall creating CSS from scratch gave me a stronger sense of how structure, design, and the syntax all come together to build countless designs.

### [Member 3 Name] - AI Text Prompt CSS
[Individual reflection on AI prompting experience and lessons learned]

### [Graciela Ramirez] - AI Image+Text Prompt CSS (if applicable)
When I first tried using ChatGPT to help me write CSS for my HTML page, I thought it would be simple, but it turned out to be a real challenge. At first, I didn’t fully understand how to describe what I wanted or how to adjust the code it gave me, so the styles often didn’t look the way I imagined. I had to go through several sessions, experimenting with different prompts, reading the CSS, looking at the live output, and learning how each property affected my layout. Over time, I started to understand the logic behind the styles and how to make small tweaks that made a big difference. After a lot of trial and error, I was finally able to create a clean, functional design that matched my vision for the betty boop design and that process taught me a lot more than I had initially thougt.
