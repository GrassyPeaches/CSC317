### [Graciela Ramirez] - Hand-written CSS (Part 2)
At first, I struggled with getting layouts to align properly and remembering how different properties like flexbox, margins, and padding interact. At time I was mixing up units, which then encouraged me to write some notes to structure the whole page and base it off of. Over time, I became more comfortable experimenting with colors, spacing, and responsive design, I actually learned that debugging styles can be just as much of a headache as resolving programming errors. However, I did thoroughly enjoy researching and practicing all the handy tools involved as well as experimenting with design. Overall creating CSS from scratch gave me a stronger sense of how structure, design, and the syntax all come together to build countless designs.

### [Sydney Leake] - AI Text Prompt CSS
When typing out what I wanted the CSS to look like for the HTML, I wanted a general theme that they would give me to see if I liked it. Looking at the CSS, I wanted to change the theme from something boring to something fun and cool, so I decided to do a neon theme. The neon theme was really cool and it did have the features of hovering and all the extra things for the assignment. Though the one issue with it was that on different platforms the format of the HTML had the picture in a circle and if you hovered over it, it would shine brighter around the circle versus when we regularly had it, it was and it's rectangle form. 

### [Graciela Ramirez] - AI Image+Text Prompt CSS (if applicable)
When I first tried using ChatGPT to help me write CSS for my HTML page, I thought it would be simple, but it turned out to be a real challenge. At first, I didn’t fully understand how to describe what I wanted or how to adjust the code it gave me, so the styles often didn’t look the way I imagined. I had to go through several sessions, experimenting with different prompts, reading the CSS, looking at the live output, and learning how each property affected my layout. Over time, I started to understand the logic behind the styles and how to make small tweaks that made a big difference. After a lot of trial and error, I was finally able to create a clean, functional design that matched my vision for the betty boop design and that process taught me a lot more than I had initially thougt.
