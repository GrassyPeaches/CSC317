## Individual Reflections

### [Syed Shah] - Hand-written CSS (Part 1)
After getting the structured CSS file from Graciela, I started working on improving the padding, spacing, and making sure that all the cards and elements are aligned and have enough breathing room for the content. I decided to divide the Recent Projects section into individual cards that can hold the information for each project. This not only made the section look more organized but also made it easier for the reader to analyze each project individually without straining their eyes. In addition to that, I decided to add a button-like design to the links in the Contact Me section to make them look more intuitive to click. During this process, I learned the importance of variables and using responsive units like rem. I learned that using this approach can significantly save time and help maintain a responsive design without manual effort. 

### [Graciela Ramirez] - Hand-written CSS (Part 2)
At first, I struggled with getting layouts to align properly and remembering how different properties like flexbox, margins, and padding interact. At time I was mixing up units, which then encouraged me to write some notes to structure the whole page and base it off of. Over time, I became more comfortable experimenting with colors, spacing, and responsive design, I actually learned that debugging styles can be just as much of a headache as resolving programming errors. However, I did thoroughly enjoy researching and practicing all the handy tools involved as well as experimenting with design. Overall creating CSS from scratch gave me a stronger sense of how structure, design, and the syntax all come together to build countless designs.

### [Sydney Leake] - AI Text Prompt CSS
When typing out what I wanted the CSS to look like for the HTML, I wanted a general theme that they would give me to see if I liked it. Looking at the CSS, I wanted to change the theme from something boring to something fun and cool, so I decided to do a neon theme. The neon theme was really cool and it did have the features of hovering and all the extra things for the assignment. Though the one issue with it was that on different platforms the format of the HTML had the picture in a circle and if you hovered over it, it would shine brighter around the circle versus when we regularly had it, it was and it's rectangle form. 

### [Graciela Ramirez] - AI Image+Text Prompt CSS (if applicable)
When I first tried using ChatGPT to help me write CSS for my HTML page, I thought it would be simple, but it turned out to be a real challenge. At first, I didn’t fully understand how to describe what I wanted or how to adjust the code it gave me, so the styles often didn’t look the way I imagined. I had to go through several sessions, experimenting with different prompts, reading the CSS, looking at the live output, and learning how each property affected my layout. Over time, I started to understand the logic behind the styles and how to make small tweaks that made a big difference. After a lot of trial and error, I was finally able to create a clean, functional design that matched my vision for the betty boop design and that process taught me a lot more than I had initially thougt.

### [Syed Shah] - AI Text Prompt CSS
At first I was a little confused how to approach this, there are dozens of AI tools to choose from, one is better in code, the other is better is understading prompts, but I decided to just use ChatGPT to see what kind of response it will produce. I gave ChatGPT our html file and asked it it give me a css file with specific instructions. Af frist I was impressed by the results, but after paying attention I noticed there were a lot of things that could have been better, I kept giving it specific prompts to fix things, and I think it took me abour 6 -6 prompts to get something that I felt comfortable using. I learned that while AI is amazingly fast, knows a lot, and can help expedite things, it is not creative, yet. A human can take help to expedite things but originality and sense to creativeity is missing.  

## Group Preferred Version
[Explain which version the group prefers and why - this should be a consensus decision]
Our group discussed with each other to reach a consensus on our preferred CSS theme after exploring all of our designs. Each member presented their version, we compared the color schemes, typography, aesthetics, theme, and overall usability. After discussing the pros and cons of each, we agreed we really liked Syed's modern, minimalist theme that balanced clean visuals with easy readability. The decision-making process required compromise and active listening, but ultimately, we chose our hybrid version, becayse we found that combining the best elements from each design created a cohesive and visually appealing final theme everyone was happy with.

## Collaboration Experience
Our team of four collaborated on designing the several files for our shared CSS project, combining creativity, experimentation and consistent collaboration. Each member contributed uniquely: four individual CSS files were generated using AI tools, mainy using Open AI's chatGPT, one was a hybrid version combining AI-generated and manual edits, and one was entirely handwritten. While the technical aspects went smoothly, for the most part. Our main challenges were communication, scheduling, and coordination on our collaborated project on GitHub. Coordinating meeting times was difficult due to different class schedules, and at times, miscommunication led to overlapping edits or missing updates on shared files. We addressed these issues by setting clearer deadlines, using shared documents for progress tracking, and scheduling regular check-ins on Whatsapp. Through this experience, we learned how important consistent communication and time management are in teamwork, especially when balancing multiple workflows, tools, and a multi-layered project such as this.
